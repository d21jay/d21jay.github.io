Greetings,<br>
Hope you are doing well. I am Jayendra Kumar. An Engineer and an artist. &#x1F609 I'm currently a software developer working at VMware with the HCX team. (yeah, the one who provide you with cross-cloud/ hybrid-cloud migration and disaster recovery options on DC running on VMware solutions.) Previously, during another glorius chapter of my life, was an undergrad at [Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur](http://www.iitk.ac.in/), where I majored in Electrical Engineering and completed second major in Mechanical Engineering. On a sidenote, have minor in Algorithms and also in Machine Learning and Applications too. Yes, I explored a lot!. 

I am intrigued with almost anything scientific in nature and always curious about the mechanics and the idea. A physics lover, chess player, and an athelete in past life &#x1F61B . Love solving puzzles and discussing algorithms, so do reach out if you too!
