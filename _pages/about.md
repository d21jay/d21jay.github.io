Greetings,<br>
Hope you are doing well. I am Jayendra Kumar. An Engineer and an artist. &#x1F609; I'm currently a backend software developer working at Nutanix in R&D - DR & Backup Team. DR & Backup Team is responsible for all the DR(Disaster Recovery) services on the hyper-converged Nutanix platforms(accessed via say Prism) and these services like most Nutanix services are Hypervisor, cloud solutions, and hardware agnostic. Before Nutanix, I was working at Amazon in DP-pinfo team of BuyX organisation. DP-pinfo owns most of the features on the Display Page(a.k.a. the landing page) for any product that you browse on the Amazon Retail Website. Before joining Amazon, I was a backend developer at VMware in the HCX team. (HCX provides you with cross-cloud/ hybrid-cloud migration and disaster recovery options on DC running with VMware solutions.) Previously, during another glorious chapter of my life, I was an undergrad at [Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur](http://www.iitk.ac.in/), where I majored in Electrical Engineering and completed a second major in Mechanical Engineering. On a side note, I have a minor in Algorithms and another in Machine Learning and Applications too. Yes, I explored a lot! 

I am intrigued with almost anything scientific in nature and always curious about the mechanics and the idea. A physics lover, chess player, and an athlete in past life &#x1F61B; . I love solving puzzles and discussing algorithms, so do reach out if you too!
